# FORK

Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is referred to as the child process. The calling process is referred to as the parent process.

	  * Fail: When there is no memory to allocate.


# STAT

Display file or file system status.

	*Arguments: char filename, stat buffer


# KILL

Sends a signal to a process.

	Arguments:
	*pid_t:  
	    If pid is positive, then signal sig is sent to the process with the
        ID specified by pid.

        If pid equals 0, then sig is sent to every process in the process
        group of the calling process.

        If pid equals -1, then sig is sent to every process for which the
        calling process has permission to send signals, except for process 1
        (init), but see below.

        If pid is less than -1, then sig is sent to every process in the
        process group whose ID is -pid.

	*int sig:
	    If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but existence and permission
       	checks are still performed; this can be used to check for the
       	existence of a process ID or process group ID that the caller is
       	permitted to signal.

	Fail:

	*if the target process or process group does not exist

	*if the calling process does not have permission to send the signal to any of the 	target process.

	+if an invalid signal was specified


#MMAP

map or unmap files or devices into memory

	Arguments:
		mmap:
			*void *addr
			*size_t length
			*int prot
			*int flags
			*int fd
			*off_t offset

	munmap:
			*void* addr
			*size_t length

# CHMOD

chang file mode bits

	Arguments:
		chmod:
			*char *pathname
			*mode_t mode

		fchmod:
			*int fd
			*mode_t mode

	Fail:

		*file does not exist
		*a component of the path prefix is not a directory
		*The file descriptor fd is not valid


# WAITPID

    *wait for process to change state

	Arguments:
		*pid_t wait:
			**int *wstatus

		*pid_t waitpid:
			**pid_t pid
			**int *wstatus
			**int options

		*int waitid:
			**idtype_t idtype
			**id_t id
			**siginfo_t *infop
			**int options


# What is a trap instruction?

A trap istruction is a procedure call that synchronously transfer the control. It is a software interrupt generated by the user program or by an error when the operating system is needed by it to perform the system calls or an operation.
